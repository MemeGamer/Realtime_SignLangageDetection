# Realtime_SignLangageDetection
Check the handLandMarks.png
P8_P12 means the distance between Point 8 and Point 12 in hand landmark
P8 a point is a list of two varibles x and y that will ouptput a pixel int_value
by finding the hypotenuse between the two Points P8 and P12 we can use it in if loop to detec various sign languages 
further mode points can be created on  screen to measure the distance between the point and your hand landmark, as done in Food loop 
the distance between the center point of the head detection and the middle finger is calculated to see if it closed to the mouth.

Import dependencies to make it function without any errors.
